Predict the survival using Kaggle Titanic data set


The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, the Titanic sank on her maiden voyage after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1,502 out of 2,224 passengers and crew. This tragedy shocked the international community and led to improved safety regulations. 

One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

I did a background search on this disaster to to familiarize myself with this data set. From what I found, the Titanic could carry a total of 3547 people, but at the time of the disaster, it only had 2224 people onboard. Which means that it was not even at its full capacity. However, the Titanic's lifeboat system was designed to ferry passengers to nearby rescue vessels, not to hold everyone onboard at once. There were a total of 18 lifeboats on Titatnic's upperdecks, but records show due to poor management some lifeboats left without filling to full capacity. 

After the initial collision with the iceberg, it took two hours and forty minutes until it completely sank. The crew of the Titanic sent wireless messages asking for help but all nearby vessels were hours away. The Titanic was on its maiden voyage and some records show that the crew who was working on the Titanic didn't have the proper disaster management training. Also Titanic did receive the warning about ice fields before hand but at the time of the collision it was cruising at its full speed. 

In summary, the lack of lifeboats, poor disaster management, and poor decision making cost 1,502 lives and completely change the maritime regulations.
